# 🔄 Angular Custom Two-Way Binding

This Angular project demonstrates how to **implement custom two-way data binding** between components using `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators.  
It recreates the behavior of Angular’s built-in `[(ngModel)]` and helps understand how parent-child communication and data synchronization work internally.
